# trk

An unrefined cli time tracker.


## Usage

    trk
        shows the report and the current timer if active
    trk s <entry_name>
        starts tracking a named entry
    trk t
        stops the current tracking
    trk l

It's main use currently is to track the time spent on things in the current day.

It could be much more useful if it can report a weekly tracking.
